Picking Projects #
I prioritize projects based on three key factors: High-Value Projects: I seek projects that leverage my expertise and create significant impact for founders, and in return, equitable compensation.</description></item><item><title>Generative AI Community: General Guide</title><link>https://nirantk.com/community/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/community/</guid><description>About #

I help startups and founders build AI products and services. This includes things like LLMs and Vector Databases, which are amazing tools which unlock a lot of new, intelligent value but also have their own limits.
I recently built FastEmbed, an embedding library built for speed using ONNX. It is maintained with Qdrant - a vector search engine.
Trivia:
Dr. Andrew Ng recommends Awesome NLP, a repo I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained since 2018 at Stanford&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning course CS 230.</description></item><item><title>Demo Day 10th October 2023</title><link>https://nirantk.com/demoday102023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 00:59:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/demoday102023/</guid><description>Details of Demos #
