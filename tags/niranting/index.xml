This is based on organising GenerativeAI Meetups in Bengaluru, India. This is a living document and will be updated as we learn more.
Venue #
Camera: Consider the requirements for A/V if planning to do talks, streaming, or recording? Who is going to record? What kind of camera do we need? GenerativeAI outsources this to Hasgeek. Security: Keep in mind some venues might require pre-registration for security. Different venues enforce security with varying degrees of strictness.</description></item><item><title>AI4Humans: Software x LLMs</title><link>https://nirantk.com/talks/ai4bharat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/talks/ai4bharat/</guid><description>AI4Bharat, IIT Madras, July 2023
Namaste! üôè I&amp;rsquo;m Nirant and here&amp;rsquo;s a brief of what we discussed in our session.
Why You Should Care? #
I have a track record in the field of NLP and machine learning, including a paper at ACL 2020 on Hinglish, the first Hindi-LM, and an NLP book with over 5000 copies sold. I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to IndicGlue by AI4Bharat, built and deployed systems used by Nykaa, and consulted for healthcare enterprises and YC companies.</description></item><item><title>Beyond First 90 Days</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/beyond-first-90-days/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/beyond-first-90-days/</guid><description>This one&amp;rsquo;s gonna be brief and echoes 2 Less Obvious Ideas to the younger me.
I am assuming that you already know the hygiene factors: Make few promises. Keep most of them and exceed few of them atleast. Get to like the top 5% in the skill of effort estimation for your own work at the very least. And so on.
Contribute to Developer Ecosystem #
Improving any part of the developer ecosystem is useful and visible at the same time.</description></item><item><title>Dos and Don'ts for ML Hiring</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/ml-hiring/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/ml-hiring/</guid><description>This is primarily for my future self. These are observations based on my own experience of 2 years at Verloop.io and helping a few companies hire for similar roles.
Do #
Seniormost hire first: Start by hiring the senior most person you&amp;rsquo;re going to hire. E.g. start by hiring the ML Lead (assuming you already have a CTO) Have a means to tell that your investment in data science is working out or not Closest to User first: Hire the person who will consume the data to build for the user first Sourcing: Begin sourcing early and over-emphasise two channels: Referrals and Portfolios Typically, in India - expect: ~2 months to close a full time role at early career (0-3 years) and ~3 months to close a mid career (3-7 years) and 6+ months to close a senior hire If a developer has open source code contributions in the last 2-3 years, consider waving off the coding or algorithmic challenge to speed up the interview process Pay above market cash salaries In 12-18 months from now, when your ML Engineer will have internalised all the requirements, company culture and built a bunch of important tooling - she would get an offer which is 2-3x of today.</description></item><item><title>Why I Quit Data Science</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/why-i-quit-data-science/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/why-i-quit-data-science/</guid><description>Question from a friend: I am interested in knowing how did you come to this decision of moving to SWE from DS/MLE. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked a variant of this question quite a few times, I thought it would be good to share my answer.
What kind of research did you do to get to this decision? #
I spoke to a lot of people who were both big companies and startups.</description></item><item><title>Anti Skills</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/antiskill/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/antiskill/</guid><description>You learn a well-paying skill and years later - it comes back to hurt you in unexpected ways. That&amp;rsquo;s an Anti Skill.
Consider this hypothetical: You start your software engineering career and build a reputation as someone who is good at iOS development. Each year, the money you make keeps improving as you keep getting better at it.
The downside? You&amp;rsquo;ll find it hard to get job offers outside of iOS development [1]</description></item><item><title>Breaking into NLP</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/breaking-into-nlp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/breaking-into-nlp/</guid><description>Bulk of this is borrowed from notes made my teammate and friend at Verloop.io&amp;rsquo;s NLP/ML team of our conversations. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the liberty to remove our internal slang and some boring stuff.
I want to build a community around me on NLP. How can I get discovered by others?
Broadly speaking, the aim in forming connections can be split into Long Term and Short term. A short term aim would be where you can receive something immediate out of the connections or a particular connection itself.</description></item><item><title>Belief Arbitrage</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/belief_arbitrage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/belief_arbitrage/</guid><description>This is a 3 part essay.
Part 1: Talent #
In my teenage years, I first understood that the kind of family you‚Äôre born into gives you access to certain kinds of wealth e.g. money, network, habits/knowledge and social capital to do things you want.
Most people in my peer group and even among the adults I could speak to, used these resources to make their own life materially more comfortable.</description></item><item><title>Politics at Work</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/politics_at_work/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 May 2021 23:29:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/politics_at_work/</guid><description>This quick entry is partially inspired by a similar entry from Manas Saloi. Ofc, other folks have offered their opinions on Basecamp and earlier Coinbase.
The woke mob is shitting on Jason and DHH, but I strongly agree with Basecamp‚Äôs new policies. IMHO a company is supposed to create an environment where people come and do their best work without having to align to one side of the political spectrum.</description></item><item><title>Character is Net Worth</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/character-is-net-worth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/character-is-net-worth/</guid><description>A useful metaphor to think about character of a person is their financial ‚Äúnet worth‚Äù. Like your net worth, this does not mean that you have that much cash to spend. It is a sum total of something.
Net Worth is the Sum Total of the Assets &amp;amp; Liabilities
Character is the Sum Total of the Decisions you Own: Good and Bad
Like your Net Worth can be negative due to a large liability e.</description></item></channel></rss>
