Venue #
Camera: Consider the requirements for A/V if planning to do talks, streaming, or recording? Who is going to record? What kind of camera do we need? GenerativeAI outsources this to Hasgeek. Security: Keep in mind some venues might require pre-registration for security. Different venues enforce security with varying degrees of strictness. Some venues didn&amp;rsquo;t allow anyone without registration, while the other venues allowed folks we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to attend to enter.</description></item></channel></rss>
