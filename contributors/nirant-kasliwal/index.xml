This is a living document and will be updated as we learn more.
Venue #
Date &amp;amp; Time &amp;amp; Duration: Choose suitable timing and duration. Pick something that works for your community. Consider weekday and weekend meetups both. Example: 4:00-5.00pm start on a Saturday works great in BLR! Chennai did a GenAI meetup on Saturday morning &amp;ndash; since that city wakes up early, it worked well for them.</description></item><item><title>AI4Humans: Software x LLMs</title><link>https://nirantk.com/talks/ai4bharat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:09:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/talks/ai4bharat/</guid><description>AI4Bharat, IIT Madras, July 2023
Namaste! üôè I&amp;rsquo;m Nirant and here&amp;rsquo;s a brief of what we discussed in our session.
Why You Should Care? #
I have a track record in the field of NLP and machine learning, including a paper at ACL 2020 on Hinglish, the first Hindi-LM, and an NLP book with over 5000 copies sold. I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to IndicGlue by AI4Bharat, built and deployed systems used by Nykaa, and consulted for healthcare enterprises and YC companies.</description></item><item><title>Qdrant vs pgvector - Results from the 1M OpenAI Benchmark</title><link>https://nirantk.com/writing/pgvector-vs-qdrant/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 00:00:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/pgvector-vs-qdrant/</guid><description>You may have considered using PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s pgvector extension for vector similarity search. There are good reasons why this option is strictly inferior to dedicated vector search engines, such as Qdrant.
We ran both benchmarks using the ann-benchmarks solely dedicated to processing vector data. The difference in performance is quite staggering.
Query Speed #
Final results show that pgvector lags behind Qdrant by a factor of 15 when it comes to throughput.</description></item><item><title>Exploring AI Applications, Ethics, and OpenAI's Closed Source Approach</title><link>https://nirantk.com/docs/resources/summaries/7th-may-2023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/docs/resources/summaries/7th-may-2023/</guid><description>OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s decision to not do closed source #
OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya S. explains that OpenAI is not doing closed source because of safety reasons, but because of competitive reasons. He believes models can be improved to the point in the future where it becomes a safety concern. Competitive reasons #
The competitive reasons mentioned by Ilya S. refer to Microsoft, which is a major investor in OpenAI. Microsoft has been known to use closed source models in the past, which gives them a competitive advantage.</description></item><item><title>Generative AI Group Chat: Resources, Hackathons, and Model Discussions</title><link>https://nirantk.com/docs/resources/summaries/6th-may-2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://nirantk.com/docs/resources/summaries/6th-may-2023/</guid><description>Introduction #
