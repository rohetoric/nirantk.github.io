Venue #
Date &amp;amp; Time &amp;amp; Duration: Choose suitable timing and duration. Pick something that works for your community. Consider weekday and weekend meetups both. Example: 4:00-5.00pm start on a Saturday works great in BLR! Chennai did a GenAI meetup on Saturday morning &amp;ndash; since that city wakes up early, it worked well for them.</description></item></channel></rss>
